      "body":"Bitcoin mining pool F2Pool has returned 19.8 bitcoin (BTC) to Paxos after the crypto services firm paid a $520,000 fee on a transaction worth just $2,000 earlier this week. Paxos said the overpayment was due to a \"bug\" in the corporate operations side of business. Bitcoin fees are typically no more than $20 per transaction. Blockchain data shows the funds were returned to Paxos on Friday. A bitcoin fee is what miners receive after a transaction is confirmed on the Bitcoin blockchain. Fees can be adjusted by the user to give certain transactions priority over others. \"After conducting identity verification, we have confirmed the ownership of these BTC, and fully refunded the fee to the sender,\" F2Pool wrote on X . The refund comes after intense discussion amongst the bitcoin community, with the likes of Stake.fish founder Chun Wang saying that he \"regretted\" agreeing to a refund with Paxos. Casa Hodl co-founder and early bitcoin developer Jameson Lopp praised Bitcoin as being a \"cooperative network\" after the fee was returned. \"Bitcoin is an adversarial network, but on the flip side it's also a cooperative network,\" Lopp wrote on X . \"Miners are humans too, and they realize that people make mistakes. While retaining egregious transaction fees makes for a nice short-term profit, returning those funds is the humane decision.\"",

      "body":"The Bitcoin ( BTC ) miner who received the 19.8 BTC in fees has returned the funds to blockchain infrastructure firm Paxos, after its claims that the company made the mistake of paying over $500,000 in BTC transfer fees. On Sept. 10, the crypto community was puzzled after seeing a BTC transaction that paid around $500,000 in fees to move around $2,000, while the average network fee was around $2. Various speculations were raised, with some believing that the transaction was done by copy-pasting data and accidentally pasting an output into the fee box without double-checking. On Sept. 13, Paxos announced that it was their server that made the transfer. Following its claim, the company assured its users that their funds were safe and that the funds belonged to Paxos . The company also clarified that PayPal was not involved in the mistake and admitted that the error was its own. Almost a day after Paxos\u2019 claims, the Bitcoin miner who received the funds went on X (formerly Twitter) to express frustrations after agreeing to refund the amount to Paxos. The miner asked their X followers what they would do in his stead, and a majority voted to just distribute the money to other Bitcoin miners. However, this advice doesn't appear to have been taken. Blockchain data shared by Bitcoin explorer Mempool confirmed that the funds were indeed returned on Sept. 15.

Bitcoin had shrugged off the latest United States macroeconomic data reports the day prior, joining traditional markets in heading higher despite hints that inflation was more stubborn than expected. Amid a renewed bullish mood, Michae\u0308l van de Poppe, founder and CEO of trading firm Eight, was hopeful that BTC/USD would avoid new lows. \u201cBitcoin might be able to activate a potential bullish breakout, although we need to make sure that it doesn't retest the lows again,\u201d he wrote in part of a dedicated post on X (formerly Twitter) on Sep. 14. Referencing news that Germany\u2019s largest lender, Deutsche Bank, had applied for a crypto custody licence , Van de Poppe eyed $25,000 as a level for bulls to steer the market away from. \u201cWe've seen a sweep at $25,000 and should be holding up on higher numbers. In that case, we should be holding $25,600-25,900 as beneath there we'll see a ton of stops to be activated before we can actually see some movements,\u201d he suggested. Despite remaining below a cluster of key moving averages (MAs), the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) continues to act as support \u2014 reclaimed in March and an important feature at the start of any bull market. \u201cI think that the odds of the low to be in on this cycle have increased. Why? Well, we're again holding above the 200-Week EMA and most likely will be closing above that again for this one,\u201d Van de Poppe continued. He highlighted $26,800 \u2014 the previous day\u2019s high \u2014 as the line in the sand to break through. Taking an optimistic long-range view, meanwhile, trading resource Stockmoney Lizards likewise concluded that further BTC price upside should come next.

      "body":"As bitcoin (BTC) moves higher, the recently shorted alternative cryptocurrencies like solana's SOL may see leverage liquidations and exaggerated price rallies. Since Monday's brief move below crucial support at $25,000, bitcoin has risen over 6% to trade near $26,600 at press time, CoinDesk data show. Upbeat China August retail sales and factory output data released early Friday revived risk sentiment in financial markets, clearing the way for continued price gains in the leading cryptocurrencies. Alternative cryptocurrencies like XRP, Ether (ETH), SOL, Tron's TRX, Dogecoin (DOGE) and are tracking bitcoin higher, as they usually do. The altcoin bounce comes days after traders sold these tokens, pricing in the possibility of defunct exchange FTX securing approval from the bankruptcy court to sell assets from its multi-billion dollar cryptocurrency holdings. SOL fell over 8% on Monday, leading the decline in altcoins after a court filing showed FTX's solana holdings at $1.6 billion. The recovery puts altcoin bears, who took leveraged bearish bets on SOL and other tokens on fears of potential FTX creditor selling, at risk of liquidation. Exchanges liquidate positions when the market moves against a trader's bets, leading to margin shortage and the trader fails to provide additional margin. Potential forced liquidation of shorts will likely bring additional bullish pressures for SOL's price, leading to a short squeeze-led rally. \"The biggest near-term risk (pain trade) is a positive one: short-covering of altcoins leading to leveraged liquidations driving up the entire complex. SOL is a good one to watch, for example,\" Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, said in an email. Since Monday, funding rates in perpetual futures have been consistently negative. Funding rates represent cost of holding long and short positions in perpetual futures. A positive rate implies leverage is skewed on the bullish side while a negative rate indicates otherwise. Open interest or the dollar value locked in active perpetual futures tied to SOL has increased by over 16% to a one-month high of $338 million, according to Coinglass. The combination of rising open interest and negative funding rates suggests traders have recently raised bearish bets in SOL.",
